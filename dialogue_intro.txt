s Ah, you're the new hire.
a Hi!
m Excuse the mess, we've been renovating
s Your room’s done though, so just hop in!
s You’re responsible for the emergency power system, but don’t worry -
s It’s pretty easy to understand and upgrade
a Should we just leave them in their room or…?
m They’ll be fine.
a Sarah, why would you set their first work day on new year‘s eve…
