# s Sarah
# a Alex
# m Mitchell

s Ah, you're the new hire.
a Hi!
m Excuse the mess, we've been renovating
s Your room’s done though, so just hop in!
s You’re responsible for the emergency power system, but don’t worry -
s It’s pretty easy to understand and upgrade
a Should we just leave them in their room or…?
m They’ll be fine.
a Sarah, why would you set their first work day on new year‘s eve…

# door shuts when player clicks to sit

# dialogue should start after you reach a magic number in the idle game, or after some specified time
# cabinet crashes against the door door, smashes it open, falls into the room

m Ah crap, so sorry!
a Mitchell?!
m Yeah sorry I’ll just.. try to get it out of the way…
s You’re a master of first impressions
m They’ll survive
a When I started here, you broke my desk trying to drag it somewhere you said had a “better view”

/ PAUSE

a Better view than their office
a No sunlight is a bit sad
m I mean, this whole floor is mostly below ground. 
m The windows are my lifeline
s The sunrises are always pretty from here

/ GARBAGE

m The garbage trucks seem to come often
s A bit too often
a What, you have a history with garbage trucks?
m Why would they come more often?
m Someone would need to produce more garbage
m Maybe there‘s an unknown subtenant?

/ PAUSE

m You’re sure they’re a good fit for us, right?
s Wouldn’t have hired them otherwise.

/ EMERGENCY

a I don’t like that they stopped here
m Not for us this time, is it?
s Let me check
m Should I…
s It’s fine.
sSeems they’re headed for the upstairs office.
a This job really helped me learn to distinguish between police and ambulance car lights
m Wouldn’t necessarily recommend putting that on your CV

/ PAUSE

s Still, always feels like they might be headed for our office
m It’s fine
a Is it?
a I never feel secure around them
a Maybe in an abstract sense
a But I think I‘ll do something stupid and they‘ll arrest me
m I‘m always listening if their footsteps stop before our door
m Don‘t worry

/ PAUSE

m I feel like we‘ll need the emergency power today

/ IT‘S GETTING DARK, STREET LAMPS TURN ON (constant, orangish glow)

m Why is it so bright?
m Aren‘t you worried?
a About what?
m Alex, look at these street lamps. 
m They can look inside and spy on us. 
s We had some issues with that previously
s I think
s Not that it was ever cleared up
m But we‘re sure of it
m They‘re looking at us

a I hope our new hire does a good job
a Feels like we might need it
m They‘re doing a good job
m Just hope they‘re on our side

/ CAR

a Is that guy coming straight towards us??
s The street just points towards us
a … it‘s way too straight. There‘s no indicator
a They‘re trying to crashing into us

# By now, the car should have swerved

m Faked out. Intimidation tactic

/ BLACKOUT

a Ah shit
m There we go. Come on.
m Prepare for the worst

/ BACKUP 

a Thank god
m Well Sarah, your new hire did a good job after all
a The outages have become more frequent, right?
s Feels like it
m I believe the city is cutting our power now intentionally
a They‘re probably diverting power to the datacenters just out of town
s Probably both.

# sTODO: Stuff about them previously wanting to go out for celebrations

BIG EXPLOSION (One very bright white blast, with a yellow linger?)

m Shit shit shit
a They must be close
m They‘re everywhere

/ FIREWORKS

s Fireworks…
s NYE after all
m No way those are just fireworks

/ FIRE

a What about the new hire?
m They left a while ago I think
s They‘re probably in on it

/ SMOKE

# (RADIO CHATTER)

m Ah fuck
s Shut up!

# (quietly, smaller font size?)

a I think the firemen are looking for us
s They‘re not firemen
m They want to see us dead
m Shit, if we only prepared for this
m Only got this shitty emergency power
s They‘re getting close
s Hold your breath.
s Don‘t let them see you
a What if they catch us?
m Alex, give me the hammer

/ FLASHLIGHT

a They‘re firemen…
s They‘re not. It‘s a disguise
m To think they would go to such lengths…

/ NIGHT

# LOW BASS DROWNING OUT EVERYTHING ELSE, SLIGHTLY FADES OUT AS THE SUN COMES UP

a Hey, sorry for last night
a Let myself get carried away.
a I guess I sometimes don’t need to react that quickly
a Just see where it goes
a It‘ll turn out differently anyway
a And happy new year!
