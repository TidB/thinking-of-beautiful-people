# m Mitchell

m Ah crap, so sorry!
a Mitchell?!
m Yeah sorry I’ll just.. try to get it out of the way…
s You’re a master of first impressions
s If that cabinet fell into the sea you would've started a tsunami
m They’ll survive
a When I started here, you broke my desk trying to drag it somewhere you said had a “better view”

/ LONGPAUSE

a Better view than their office at least
a No sunlight is a bit sad
m I mean, this whole floor is mostly below ground
m The windows are my lifeline
a The sunrises are always pretty from here
s If I had found a lease with a better view, I would've gotten it
s Also means we're not as exposed

/ GARBAGE

m The garbage trucks seem to come often
s A bit too often
a What, you have a history with garbage trucks?
m Why would they come more often?

/ LONGPAUSE

m You’re sure they’re a good fit for us, right?
s Wouldn’t have hired them otherwise
a Okay sorry, but why were you suspicious of the garbage truck?
m I'm just thinking, I think they're not collecting garbage from other tenants
m A covert courier service, convenient for smuggling large objects
m Maybe there‘s a subtenant we don't know yet?

/ EMERGENCY

/ PAUSE

a I don’t like that they stopped here
m Not for us this time, is it?
s Let me check
m Should I…
s It’s fine
s Seems they’re headed for the upstairs office
a This job really helped me learn to distinguish between police and ambulance car lights
m Wouldn’t necessarily recommend putting that on your CV

/ PAUSE
/ STOPSIREN

s Still, always feels like they might be headed for our office
m It’s fine
a Is it?
a I never feel secure around them
a Maybe in an abstract sense
a But I think I‘ll do something stupid and they‘ll arrest me
m I‘m always listening if their footsteps stop before our door
m Don‘t worry. We got it under control
s The police is the last of our worries

/ PAUSE

m I feel like we‘ll need the emergency power today
m I can already see the garbage truck arriving at the landfill, heading toward a new, temporary building
m Clueless new workers sort the contents and put them on conveyor belts which head into the landfill
m Inside, there's a cave with more and more workers deciphering the contents

/ LONGPAUSE
/ LONGPAUSE

/ STREETLAMPS

/ PAUSE

m Why is it so bright?
m Aren‘t you worried?
a About what?
m Alex, look at these street lamps
m They can look inside and spy on us
s We had some issues with that previously
s I think
s Not that it was ever cleared up
m But we‘re sure of it
m They‘re looking at us
s Caught some of them yesterday. The reflection of a camera lens blew their cover

a I hope our new hire does a good job
a Feels like we might need it
m They‘re doing a good job
m Just hope they‘re on our side
a You wanna go out with them for the new year's celebrations?
s Theoretically yes
s But it's very unsafe out there. So many random people
m Looking at us
s Following us back to the office
a Pulling out their lockpicks

/ LONGPAUSE
/ LONGPAUSE

m Can't wait for the new year honestly
s I can

/ CAR

s This year was good, wasn't it?
m Mmh
s Still worried?
m We need to be more cautious.
a Is that guy driving straight towards us?
m It's normal, isn't it? We're next to an intersection
a … it‘s way too straight. And too fast
s I don't like this
a They‘re trying to crash into us
s Get down!

/ SHORTPAUSE

m Faked out. Intimidation tactic
s Got betrayed by their conscience
a Next time he'll drive into us. Burn down the office. And get away with it.

/ PAUSE

/ BLACKOUT
/ SHORTPAUSE

a Ah shit
m There we go. Come on
m Prepare for the worst

/ BACKUP 

a Thank god
m Well Sarah, your new hire did a good job after all
s I'm not sure. Look how weak the light is
s It's almost worse than no light at all
a The outages have become more frequent, right?
s Feels like it
m I believe the city is cutting our power now intentionally
a They‘re probably diverting power to the datacenters just out of town
s Probably both
a We should maybe go off-grid entirely
a Having an autarkic base would help us defend
s There was a phase where I disavowed isolation
s But it's the only way forward

/ LONGPAUSE
/ PAUSE

/ EXPLOSION

m Shit shit shit
a They must be close
m They‘re everywhere
m The hunter gave a warning shot and startled all the animals
s He looks at himself with grim satisfaction

/ FIREWORKS

a They're running towards us now
s With their bright, exploding heads
m Still looking at us
s Fireworks…
s NYE after all
m No way those are just fireworks
m I'm blocking the windows
s So many people on the streets. Sounds like they're celebrating
m They're not celebrating, they're rioting. I can hear their voices closing in on us
a Why did you bring me into this?
s We need you to defend this. All of this
m I can still hear the muffled explosions through the triple-glazed windows
m THEY CAN STILL SEE US

/ LONGPAUSE
/ BLIND

m There. We're safe, for now
s Muffled sounds, muffled sights
a Feels like a grave. But safer. Graves aren't safe
m I read about that
s Last sunday. I saw a group at the cemetery
s Dressed in black. Slow-moving
a Observing
m Controlling
s Only had point A and B. Moved between them. Nothing else
m Controlled
s Observed

/ LONGPAUSE
/ FIRE

a What about the new hire?
m They left a while ago I think
s They‘re probably in on it
s Snuck out
a Why would they–
a I can see why
m They're at our most vulnerable spot
s What can we count on, if not our emergencies?

/ SMOKE

m Ah fuck
m They're coming
m We got smoked out like rats
a They're gonna clean up later and carry our bodies to the landfill
a To the cave under the landfill
a Where they'll scan and sort us
s Shut up!

a I think the firemen are looking for us
s They‘re not firemen
m They want to see us dead
m Shit, if we only prepared for this
m Only got this shitty emergency power
s They‘re getting close
s Hold your breath
s Don‘t let them see you
a What if they catch us?
m Alex, give me the hammer

/ LONGPAUSE
/ FLASHLIGHT

a They‘re firemen…
s They‘re not. It‘s a disguise
m To think they would go to such lengths…
s They will blind you. And then take you to the landfill

/ NIGHT

/ LONGPAUSE
/ LONGPAUSE

a A strange night
a Let myself get carried away
a I guess I sometimes don’t need to react that quickly
a Just see where it goes
a It‘ll turn out differently anyway
a Most of our specters are our own creations

/ LONGPAUSE
/ END

a Well, let's get out of here
a And happy new year!
