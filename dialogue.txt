m Ah crap, so sorry!
a Mitchell?!
m Yeah sorry I’ll just.. try to get it out of the way…
s You’re a master of first impressions
s If that cabinet fell into the sea you would've started a tsunami
m They’ll survive
a When I started here, you broke my desk trying to drag it somewhere you said had a “better view”

/ PAUSE

a Better view than their office at least
a No sunlight is a bit sad
m I mean, this whole floor is mostly below ground
m The windows are my lifeline
a The sunrises are always pretty from here
s If I had found a lease with a better view, I would've gotten it

/ GARBAGE

m The garbage trucks seem to come often
s A bit too often
a What, you have a history with garbage trucks?
m Why would they come more often?

/ PAUSE

m You’re sure they’re a good fit for us, right?
s Wouldn’t have hired them otherwise
a Okay sorry, but why were you suspicious of the garbage truck?
m Someone would need to produce more garbage
m Maybe there‘s an unknown subtenant?

/ EMERGENCY

/ PAUSE

a I don’t like that they stopped here
m Not for us this time, is it?
s Let me check
m Should I…
s It’s fine.
s Seems they’re headed for the upstairs office.
a This job really helped me learn to distinguish between police and ambulance car lights
m Wouldn’t necessarily recommend putting that on your CV

/ PAUSE

s Still, always feels like they might be headed for our office
m It’s fine
a Is it?
a I never feel secure around them
a Maybe in an abstract sense
a But I think I‘ll do something stupid and they‘ll arrest me
m I‘m always listening if their footsteps stop before our door
m Don‘t worry

/ PAUSE

m I feel like we‘ll need the emergency power today

/ PAUSE

/ STREETLAMPS

/ PAUSE

m Why is it so bright?
m Aren‘t you worried?
a About what?
m Alex, look at these street lamps
m They can look inside and spy on us
s We had some issues with that previously
s I think
s Not that it was ever cleared up
m But we‘re sure of it
m They‘re looking at us

a I hope our new hire does a good job
a Feels like we might need it
m They‘re doing a good job
m Just hope they‘re on our side

/ PAUSE

/ CAR

m Can't wait for the new year honestly
s I can
s This year was good, wasn't it?
m Mmh
a Is that guy driving straight towards us?
a There!
m It's normal, isn't it? We're next to an intersection
a … it‘s way too straight. And too fast
s I don't like this
a They‘re trying to crash into us
s Get down!

# By now, the car should have swerved

m Faked out. Intimidation tactic
s Got betrayed by their conscience
a Next time he'll drive into us. Burn down the office. And get away with it.

/ PAUSE

/ BLACKOUT

a Ah shit
m There we go. Come on
m Prepare for the worst

/ BACKUP 

a Thank god
m Well Sarah, your new hire did a good job after all
a The outages have become more frequent, right?
s Feels like it
m I believe the city is cutting our power now intentionally
a They‘re probably diverting power to the datacenters just out of town
s Probably both

# TODO: Stuff about them previously wanting to go out for celebrations

/ PAUSE

/ EXPLOSION

m Shit shit shit
a They must be close
m They‘re everywhere

/ FIREWORKS

s Fireworks…
s NYE after all
m No way those are just fireworks
m I'm blocking the windows
s So many people on the streets. Sounds like they're celebrating
m They're not celebrating, they're rioting. I can hear their voices closing in on us
a Why did you bring me into this?

/ BLIND

m There. We're safe, for now

/ FIRE

a What about the new hire?
m They left a while ago I think
s They‘re probably in on it
s Snuck out
a Why would they–


/ SMOKE

# (RADIO CHATTER)

m Ah fuck
m We got smoked out like rats
a They're gonna clean up later and carry our bodies to the landfill
s Shut up!

a I think the firemen are looking for us
s They‘re not firemen
m They want to see us dead
m Shit, if we only prepared for this
m Only got this shitty emergency power
s They‘re getting close
s Hold your breath
s Don‘t let them see you
a What if they catch us?
m Alex, give me the hammer

/ FLASHLIGHT

a They‘re firemen…
s They‘re not. It‘s a disguise
m To think they would go to such lengths…

/ NIGHT

# LOW BASS DROWNING OUT EVERYTHING ELSE, SLIGHTLY FADES OUT AS THE SUN COMES UP

/ PAUSE
/ PAUSE
/ PAUSE
/ PAUSE
/ PAUSE
/ PAUSE

a What a night
a Let myself get carried away
a I guess I sometimes don’t need to react that quickly
a Just see where it goes
a It‘ll turn out differently anyway

/ PAUSE
/ END

a Well, let's get out of here
a And happy new year!
